       * Idea: Fill canvas with some number of random points.
       * As you move mouse around, highlight the triangle that contains the mouse.
       * Then, create its circumcircle and scale it out to infinity and fade out.

       * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation
       *
       * Dual graphs -- Delaunay & Voronoi.
       *
       * Can we get back into like horocycles etc? They are dual right?
       *
       * Yeah, jeez, we should be able to do all kind of wild stuff with hyperbolic geom, Poincare plane... damn.
       *
       * so yeah if you had Delaunay, you could drop perpendicular bisectors from the circumcenters to get the Voronoi diagram. Not quite that simple if circumcenter is outside triangle.
